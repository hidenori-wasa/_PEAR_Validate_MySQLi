The basic concept
    This package can make error handling and verification of MySQLi without writing a code by including this package.

The features list
    This package has wrapper class of MySQLi, MySQLi_STMT and MySQLi_Result class for error handling and verification.
    This becomes fast because verification code disappears on release.

The dependences
    BreakpointDebugging package
    Windows, but I want to support "Linux" in future.
    PHP >= 5.3.0
    MySQL >= 5.1

Notice
    I ignore error of following of "PHP_CodeSniffer" because this class is overriding.
        Method name "<class name>::<method name>" is not in camel caps format
