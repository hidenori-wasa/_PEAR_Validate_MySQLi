The basic concept
    This package can make error handling and verification of MySQLi without writing a code by including this package.

The features list
    This package has wrapper class of MySQLi, MySQLi_STMT and MySQLi_Result class for error handling and verification.
    This becomes fast because verification code disappears on release.

    ### The execution procedure. ###
    Procedure 1: Please, set php file format to utf8, but we should create backup of php files because multibyte strings may be destroyed.
    Procedure 2: Please, copy *_MySetting*.php as your project php file.
    Procedure 3: Please, edit *_MySetting*.php for customize.
        Then, it is possible to make specific setting about all debugging modes.
    Procedure 4: Please, copy following in your project php file.
        "require_once './BreakpointDebugging_MySetting.php';"
    Procedure 5: Please, rewrite following in your project php file.
        from "new \MySQLi" to "new \Validate\MySQLi"
    Procedure 6: Please, copy following in your project "my.ini" or "my.cnf" file.
        [mysqld]
        # It sets character sets of server, data base, table, column to "utf8". It sets collating sequence to the default "utf8_general_ci".
        character_set_server=utf8
        # It ignores character sets information which was sent from client and it uses character sets of default of server.
        skip-character-set-client-handshake
        # It writes database name, a table name, a table alias name in storage with lowercase. Therefore, it works in all OS.
        lower_case_table_names=1
        # "init_connect" is SQL statement to execute when connecting.
        # "SET NAMES 'utf8'" sets
        #       character_set_client (Character sets which client sends)
        #       character_set_connection (Character sets of literal character string)
        #       character_set_results (Character sets of query-result to return to client) to "utf8".
        #       And it sets collation_connection (Collating sequence of connection character sets) to the default collating sequence of "utf8"( utf8_general_ci).
        init_connect="SET NAMES 'utf8'"
        [mysqldump]
        default-character-set=utf8
        [mysql]
        default-character-set=utf8

    ### Exception hierarchical structure ###
    PEAR_Exception
        BreakpointDebugging_Exception
            \Validate\MySQLi_Exception
                \Validate\MySQLi_Query_Exception
                    \Validate\MySQLi_Query_Warning_Exception
                    \Validate\MySQLi_Query_Error_Exception
                \Validate\MySQLi_Connect_Exception
                \Validate\MySQLi_Warning_Exception
                \Validate\MySQLi_Error_Exception

The dependences
    BreakpointDebugging package
    Windows, but I want to support "Linux" in future.
    PHP >= 5.3.0
    MySQL >= 5.1

Notice
    I ignore error of following of "PHP_CodeSniffer" because this class is overriding.
        Method name "<class name>::<method name>" is not in camel caps format
